# Vespa.ai Engineering Playground
Some times, the engineers at Vespa.ai just wants to play around with some ideas. Some might be really good ideas. Some might be... less good ideas. This is their playground. 

Whatever you find here is _not_ supported by Vespa.ai. This is not a "beta" area nor a "labs" area indicating what to come next. There is no guarantee that these ideas will ever end up as an official Vespa.ai tool or feature at some point. But they might...

For now, feel free to take a peak and join in on the playtime.

Regards,  
The Vespa.ai Engineering Team
